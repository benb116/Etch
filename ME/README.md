#Mechanical Hardware

The CAD for this project was done in OnShape. View the assembly and parts [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a323499ca448ff5cfd3dca22/w/1d5ba33bc2795cecee47b742/e/558a06e23199a00c5437c471).

The sizes and dimensions for many of these parts will depend on the size of the TV. Take measurements of your display and make any necessary adjustments if you plan on adapting these components.

Some notes about specific parts:

* The shell is made from 0.030" Polystyrene sheets. Because the shell was designed as a sheet-metal part, the geometries could be flattened for fabrication using a laser cutter. A rigid template piece could also be created and used as a guide to trace out parts. Once the sheets are cut, they can be bent over a jig by heating the bend lines with a hot air gun. The parts were then glued together and painted.
* Because I didn't trust an interference fit to hold the large knobs on the small stepper motor D-shafts (and the exposed length of the shafts was fairly short), I machined two shaft couplers. The couplers have built in set screws to hold the motor D-shafts and fit more snuggly into the knobs.
* The knobs are 3D printed and designed to not require supports if printed face down. Consider reducing infill and increasing the wall thickness to decrease the print time.
* 3D printed brackets hold the motors to the TV. I did not want the polystyrene frame to support their weight and forces. Because TVs have no mounting features, the brackets are adhered to the TV using VHB.
* Ribs help position the shell on the TV.
* Thin spacer parts separate the Motor Boards from the motors and ensure that the magnetic sensor is correctly spaced.
