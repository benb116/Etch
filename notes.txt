Polygon infill like 3d printing?

Convert image to topological map where brightness => height
    Gradient?
    White is flat, black is steep -> more lines around steep areas
    Issue with connecting the lines
    Do seam-carving style energy cumsum left right up down

Canny-edge to find patches
    Hatch each patch based on brightness

Inkscape to make 2 tone shapes
For each color
    For each path
        Gen hatch with shapely
        Output pts

Jump probability between each pixel
Selfie drawing

- Find image of continuous line drawing
