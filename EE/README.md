Along with a Raspberry Pi, Etch utilized two unique custom PCBs to route signals and power to various components.

1. Motor Board - Mounted to the back of each stepper motor, this PCB has a stepper motor driver to control the knob and a magnetic encoder to read the knob's position.
2. Breakout board - Mounted in the center of the TV, this PCB routes signals from the Pi to the correct board. It also distributes motor power.
