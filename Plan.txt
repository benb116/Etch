Adafruit controller     Rotary encoders

Steppers -----------------------


Server:
    Write in Python? Better motor integration, all frontend stuff goes through browser
    Set up websocket between client and server
        Auto Mode - server sends msgs with link to points file, client responds with OK, server sends start time
        Manual Mode - server sends step msgs (vert and hor), clear cmd
    Auto Mode - Cycle through program, send WS updates
    Manual - Monitor inputs for motor steps, mirror them in WS

Auto Mode:
    #define drawing speed (pix/sec)
    #define rotational movement (pix/rev)

    Clear screen
    Choose drawing
    Load points
    Calculate timing
        Get distances of each line segment
        Get duration of each segment
        Cumsum delays
    Determine start timestamp
    Send data to Screen and python
    pause until timestamp, then play

Manual Mode:
    #define rotational movement (pix/rev)
    #define encoder steps/rev

    For each motor:
        Interrupt one signal
        On leading edge:
            (other signal) ? dir1 step : dir2 step

Mechanical
    Frame: wood/plastic. Maybe foam? Have to mount motors
    Knobs - Printed plastic
    How to mount encoders?
